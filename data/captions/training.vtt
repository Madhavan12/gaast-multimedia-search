00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280
Welcome to what I believe to be YouTube's only complete and totally free private pilot ground course.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:11.000
Throughout this series, I will teach you everything you need to know in order to earn your wings as a pilot.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
What's up guys? I'm Josh and this is my father-in-law Mike.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And this is lesson one on my totally free private pilot ground course.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Today we're going to be talking about the four forces that act on an airplane while it's in flight.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
This is a super important lesson because if you have a basic understanding of aerodynamics,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
this is going to give you a good foundation that you can start building on throughout your training.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Plus, these questions might be on the written test.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Oh, I didn't mention that there's a written test?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Oh yeah, there's a written test and you've got to pass it with at least a 70%.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
But don't worry, I got you.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Anyway, let's take a look at these four forces that affect our airplane in flight.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
As you can see, these forces are lift, weight, thrust and drag.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Now the first force you should know about is lift.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
As you can see, this is the upward force that actually picks the aircraft up away from the ground.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
And this is caused by basically two things, relative wind and the wing design.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Now we pilots have a super fancy name for this wing design.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
We call it an airfoil.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
But I don't want to go into too much detail on that right now because we're going to be talking about that in more detail in the next lesson.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
The next force we need to consider when flying an aircraft is weight.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Now weight is simply the combined load of all the people on board the aircraft, all the fuel, any baggage or cargo you might have,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and even the aircraft itself.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
It includes everything on board the aircraft.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
The other thing you should know about the weight is that it opposes lift and acts downward through the center of gravity.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Now, we'll discuss the center of gravity more in an upcoming episode.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
But the center of gravity is basically where the average weight of the aircraft and everything on board is centered.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:09.000
If you could hang an airplane from a string and you were to place the center of gravity directly beneath the string, the aircraft would balance perfectly.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Now, here's something that may not make a lot of sense yet, but it's important to know.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
In steady, unaccelerated flight, lift and weight are both equal.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
But we'll come back to that here in just a second.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Next, we have thrust, and this is the force that propels our aircraft forward.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Thrust is typically created by some kind of engine and propeller working together, or a rotor for you helicopter nerds out there.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Now, the important thing to know about thrust is that in order to move the aircraft forward, you must first overcome drag, which we depict here as a rearward force.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
But really, this force just opposes forward movement, and that drag makes it difficult to move the aircraft forward.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And there are two types of drag that you should be concerned about as a pilot.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Parasite drag and induced drag.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
What happens when you stick your hand out of the window of a moving vehicle?

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
The wind pulls your hand back, doesn't it?

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
The faster you drive, the more your hand gets pulled back.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:10.000
This is what we call parasite drag, and just like it does when you stick your hand out of a moving vehicle, parasite drag increases as airspeed increases.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
As you can see from this chart, it increases exponentially with faster air speeds.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
That's one of the reasons why we can't fly super fast in our training aircraft.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
There's way too much parasite drag holding the airplane back at high airspeed.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Now, there are actually three different types of parasite drag, and the first one is form drag.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
In a nutshell, form drag is wind that goes around the shape of the aircraft.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
How much form drag do you think an aircraft of this shape would produce?

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Probably a lot, right?

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
It's not a smooth round shape that can allow air to smoothly flow around it.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Another type of parasite drag is interference drag.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:53.000
This one might be a little bit harder to understand, but this type of drag occurs when different streams of air flow create little pockets of turbulence at different places on the aircraft,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
and this restricts the smooth air flow around the surface of the aircraft.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Next, we have skin friction drag.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
This type of parasite drag is dragged that's caused by the surface of the aircraft.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:11.000
If we were able to zoom in with a microscope and look at the skin of the aircraft, what you find is that it's actually not as smooth as it looks.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Wind can still act on these little microscopically rough areas and reduce the speed of our aircraft.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:25.000
As you might have noticed, we typically paint or polish the exterior surfaces of an aircraft to reduce skin friction drag, but it's never completely eliminated.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Induced drag is the other type of drag that affects our aircraft.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
It's created as a direct result of lift.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.000
I'm going to explain this more in the next episode, but our wings direct the relative wind above and below the surface of the wing,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
and this creates lift, but it also creates induced drag.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Now, induced drag is kind of weird.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.000
As airspeed increases, the wing gets more efficient, and because of that, induced drag actually decreases.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Here's what's interesting.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:59.000
If we were to look at these two types of drag on a chart, what you find is that parasite drag increases exponentially with airspeed,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
but induced drag decreases exponentially with airspeed.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Because of that, there's a magical little airspeed range on every aircraft where we can achieve the least amount of drag possible when we're out flying around,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
and a lot of airspeed you're going to be flying are directly related to this airspeed.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Pilots often refer to this as the lift to drag ratio, or LD max.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
You might be wondering why it's called the lift to drag ratio and not the thrust to drag ratio.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Well, just like lift and weight, in steady unaccelerated flight, thrust and drag are both equal.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
But all these forces are directly related to each other.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
You're probably wondering why the heck we're learning about aerodynamics today.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
You just want to get into the plane and start flying.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
But if you understand this concept, it's going to help you understand how to control the aircraft.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Any time I make an adjustment to any one of these forces, it's going to cause a change in one of the other forces.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Now, we said that during steady unaccelerated flight, lift and weight are both equal.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Now that I've got my airplane trimmed down for level flight, let's see what happens when I increase my airspeed by increasing my thrust.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Alright, so I've got the airplane all trimmed out. I'm at 1600 feet, somewhere around 85 knots.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Watch what happens when I just increase my thrust. Just watch what happens here.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
I don't have my hands on the controls, but notice the airplane is starting to climb.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
So thrust and weight are no longer equal.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
As you can see, my wings start creating more lift when we accelerate.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:39.000
When I increase my thrust, my lift becomes greater than my weight, and the opposite is true when I decelerate.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Okay, now I'm trimmed out for level unaccelerated flight again.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000
At this point, thrust and drag are equal, but what happens if I increase my lift?

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Watch my airspeed as I raise the nose of the aircraft.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
I don't fly at 80 knots. I'm at 2000 feet.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Okay?

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
So watch my airspeed when I raise the nose of the airplane up.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
So I'm increasing lift right now. Watch my airspeed.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Yeah, that's right. The airspeed is bleeding off. I made a change.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Before I increased my lift, we were in steady unaccelerated flight.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
When I increased my lift, I also increased my induced drag.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
And this caused my drag to be stronger than the thrust which slowed down my aircraft.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Understanding these basic principles is probably the most important step to learning how to control an airplane.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
And now that you've watched this video, you have an understanding that most pilots don't get in their first ground lesson.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000
If you want to continue learning how to fly, I recommend starting the playlist where you'll be picking up with lesson two.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
And there you can binge watch this series.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
When you take a break, you can pick up right where you left off.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Thanks for watching. See ya.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
